# ChatGPT-Generated-Elevator
I used ChatGPT to help me generate the code for an elevator to use in a Unity game.

I asked ChatGPT for permission to use the code I prompted it to create and here's that part of the conversation:

ME: Can I create a GitHub repository with the code you've provided me? I'm not asking how to create a github repo or if the code you generated will create a repo. I'm asking for permission.

CHATGPT: As an AI language model, I don't have the authority to grant permission on behalf of the authors of the code provided. However, the code I provided was intended for educational purposes and is free to use and modify. Therefore, you can create a GitHub repository with the code I provided, as long as you adhere to the licensing terms and conditions specified in the code or accompanying documentation, and any relevant laws and regulations.
